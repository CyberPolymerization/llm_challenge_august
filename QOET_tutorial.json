  "0": "The differential input resistance of the LTC6416 module when the input voltage is ±1.2V is 12kΩ.",
  "1": "Based on the provided text, there is no mention of a feedforward capacitor, CFF, in relation to setting the output voltage of the LTC7804 module. Therefore, I do not know the function of the feedforward capacitor in this specific context.",
  "5": "Before using the AD V7611W model in automotive applications, designers should review the Specifications section of the data sheet carefully. They should also contact their local Analog Devices, Inc., account representative for specific product ordering information and to obtain the specific Automotive Reliability report for this model.",
  "47": "The purpose of the Conditional Search ROM command in the DS28E04-100 module is to allow the bus master to identify devices on a multidrop system that have to signal an important event. This command operates similarly to the Search ROM command, but only devices that fulfill certain conditions (CSR = 1) will participate in the search. After each pass of the conditional search that successfully determines the 64-bit ROM code for a specific device on the multidrop bus, that particular device can be individually accessed as if a Match ROM had been issued. This allows the bus master to access and communicate with specific devices on the bus while all other devices have dropped out of the search process and are waiting for a reset pulse.",
  "50": "Based on the provided text, there is no specific information about the recommended range for the value of C1 in the LTC7804 module. Therefore, I do not know the recommended range for the value of C1 or the reason for choosing that range."
