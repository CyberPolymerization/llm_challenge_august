Stresses above those listed under Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause p ermanent damage to the deviceThis is a stress 
rating only; functional operation of the device at these or any 
other conditions above those indicated in the operational section of this specification is not impliedExposure to absolute 
maximum rating cond itions for extended periods may affect 
device reliability PACKAGE THERMAL PERF ORMANCE  
To reduce power consumption when using the ADV7611, the 
user is advised to turn off the unused sections of the part 
Due to the printed circuit board ( PCB ) metal varia tion, and , 
therefore , variation in PCB heat conductivity, the value of θ JA 
may differ for various PCBs 
The most efficient measurement solution is obtained using the 
package surface temperature to estimate the die temperature 
because this eliminates the v ariance associated with the θ JA value 
The maximum junction temperature (T J MAX) of 125°C must not  be 
exceededThe following equation calculates the junction  tempera -
ture using the measured package surface temperature and  applies 
only when no heat sink is  used on the device under test (DUT):  
( )TOTAL JT S J W ΨTT ×+=  
where:  
TS is the package surface temperature (°C) 
ΨJT = 0.4°C/W for the 64- lead LQFP_EP 
WTOTAL  = ((PVDD × I PVDD) + (0.05 × TVDD × I TVDD) + (CVDD ×  
ICVDD) + (D VDD × I DVDD) + (DVDDIO × I DVDDIO ))  
where 0.05 is 5% of the TVDD power that is dissipated on the 
part itself

POWER -UP SEQUENCE  
The recommended power -up sequence of the ADV7611 is to 
power up the 3.3 V supplies first, followed by the 1.8 V supplies
Reset should be held low while the supplies are powered up 
Alternatively,  the ADV7611 may be powered up by asserting all 
supplies simultaneouslyIn this case, care must be taken while the 
supplies are being established to ensure that a lower rated supply 
does not go above a higher rated supply level 
POWER -DOWN SEQUENCE 
The ADV7611 supplies may be deasserted simultaneously as 
long as a higher rated supply does not go below a lower rated

Data Sheet ADV7611FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW 
HDMI RECEIVER  
The receiver supports all mandatory and many optional 3D 
formatsIt supports HDTV formats up to UXGA at 8 bit 
The HDMI -compatible receiver on  the ADV7611 incorporates 
programmable  equalization of the HDMI data signalsThis 
equalization compensates for the high frequency losses inherent  
in HDMI and DVI cabling, especially at longer lengths and higher 
frequencies It is capable of equalizing fo r cable lengths up to  
30 meters to achieve robust receiver performance 
With the inclusion of HDCP , displays can receive encrypted 
video contentThe HDMI interface of the ADV7611 allows for 
authentication of a video receiver, decryption of encoded data  
at the receiver, and renewability of that authentication during 
transmission, as specified by the HDCP 14 protocol 
The ADV7611 has a synchr onization regeneration block used  
to regenerate the DE based on the measurement of t he video 
format being displaye d and to filter the horizontal and vertical 
synchronization signals to prevent glitchesThe HDMI receiver 
also supports TERC4 error detection, used for detection  of 
corrupted  HDMI packet s following a cable disconnect 
The HDMI receiver contains an audio m ute controller that  
can detect a variety of conditions that may result in audible extraneous noise in the audio outputOn detection of these 
conditions, the audio signal can be ramped to prevent audio 
clicks or popsAudio output can be formatte d to L PCM  and 
IEC 61937 
The HDMI receiver features include:  
 162.5 MHz  (UXGA at 8 bit) maximum TMDS clock 
frequency  
 3D format support defined in HDMI 1.4a specification  
 Integrated equalizer for cable lengths up to 30 meters  
 HDCP 1.4

The ADV7611 has an any -to-any 3  × 3 CSC matrixThe CSC 
block is placed at the back of the CP sectionCSC enables 
YPrPb -to-RGB  and RGB -to-YCrCb conversionsMany other 
standards of color space can be implemented using the color space converter 
CP features include:  
 525i, 625i, 525p, 625p, 720p, 1080i,  1080p,  and other 
formats  
 Manual adjustments including gain (contrast) and  
offset (brightness), hue , and saturation

OTHER FEATURES  
The ADV7611 has HS, VS, FIELD, and DE output signals with 
programmable position, polarity, and width  
The ADV7611 has programmable interrupt request output pins, 
including INT1 and INT2 (INT2 is accessible only via one of 
following pins: MCLK/INT2 , SCLK/INT2 , or HPA_A/INT2)  
It also features a low power -down mod eThe I2C address of  
the main map is 0x98 after resetThis can be changed after reset 
to 0x9A if pullup is attached to VS/FIELD/ALSB pin and I2C 
command SAMPLE_ALSB is issuedRefer to the Register 
Access and Serial Ports Description  section in the UG -180
The ADV7611 is provided in a 10 mm  × 10 mm, RoHS -compliant  
LQFP_EP package, and is specified over the − 40°C to +85°C 
temperature range 
 
 
ADV7611  Data SheetPIXEL INPUT/OUTPUT F ORMATTING  
The output section of the ADV7611 is highly flexibleThe pixel 
output bus can support up to 24 -bit 4:4:4 YCrCbThe pixel data 
supports both single and double data rates modesIn SDR mod e, a 
16-/24-bit 4:2:2 or 24- bit 4:4:4 output is possibleIn DDR mode1, 
the pixel output port can be configured in an 8 -/12-bit 4:2:2 YCrCb 
or 24-bit 4:4:4 RGB 
Bus rotation is supportedTable 5 and Table 6 outline the differ ent 
output formats that are supportedAll output modes are controlled  
via I2C 
 
1 DDR mode is only supported only up to 50 MHz (an equivalent to data rate 
clocked 100 MHz clock in SDR mode) PIXEL DATA OUTPUT MO DES FEATURES  
The output pixel por t features include : 
 8-/12-bit ITU -R BT.656 4:2:2 YCrCb with embedded time 
codes and/or HS, VS, a nd FIELD output signals  
 16-/24-bit YCrCb with embedded time codes and/or HS 
and VS/FIELD pin timing
