LTC6416
16416fThe L TC®6416 is a differential unity gain buffer designed 
to drive 16-bit ADCs with extremely low output noise and excellent linearity beyond 300MHzDifferential input impedance is 12kΩ, allowing 1:4 and 1:8 transformers to be used at the input to achieve additional system gainWith no external biasing or gain setting components and 
a ﬂ  ow-through pinout, the L TC6416 is very easy to useIt can be DC-coupled and has a common mode output offset of –40mV If the input signals are AC-coupled, the L TC6416 input pins are internally biased to provide an output common mode voltage that is set by the voltage on the V
CM pinIn addition the L TC6416 has high speed, fast recovery 
clamping circuitry to limit output signal swingBoth the high and low clamp voltages are internally biased to allow maximum output swing but are also user programmable via the CLLO and CLHI pinsSupply current is nominally 42mA and the L TC6416 oper-
ates on supply voltages ranging from 2.7V to 3.9V The L TC6416 is packaged in a 10-lead 3mm × 2mm DFN 
packagePinout is optimized for placement directly adjacent to Linear’s high speed 12-, 14- and 16-bit ADCsL, L T , L TC and L TM are registered trademarks of Linear Technology CorporationAll other
