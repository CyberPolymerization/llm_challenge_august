LTC7804
1Document FeedbackTYPICAL APPLICATION  FEATURES DESCRIPTIONLow I Q Synchronous Boost Controller 
with Spread Spectrum
The LTC® 7804 is a high performance synchronous boost 
DC/DC switching regulator controller that drives an all 
N-channel power MOSFET stageSynchronous rectifica-
tion increases efficiency, reduces power losses and eases 
thermal requirementsA constant frequency current mode 
architecture allows a phase-lockable switching frequency 
of up to 3MHzThe LTC7804 operates from a wide 4.5V 
to 40V input supply rangeWhen biased from the boost 
converter output , the LTC7804 can operate from an input 
supply as low as 1V after startupThe very low no-load quiescent current extends operating 
runtime in battery powered systemsOPTI-LOOP com -
pensation allows the transient response to be optimized over a wide range of output capacitance and ESR values
The MODE pin selects among Burst Mode operation, pulse-skipping mode, or continuous inductor current 
mode at light loadsThe LTC7804 additionally features spread spectrum oper -
ation which significantly reduces the peak radiated and 
conducted noise on both the input and output supplies, making it easier to comply with electromagnetic interfer -
ence (EMI) standards.APPLICATIONS nSynchronous Operation for Highest Efficiency and Reduced Heat Dissipation

(Note 2)
Note 1: Stresses beyond those listed under Absolute Maximum Ratings 
may cause permanent damage to the deviceExposure to any Absolute Maximum Rating condition for extended periods may affect device reliability and lifetimeNote 2: The LTC7804 is tested under pulsed load conditions such 
that T
J ≈ TAThe LTC7804E is guaranteed to meet specifications from 
0°C to 85°C junction temperatureSpecifications over the –40°C to 125°C operating junction temperature range are assured by design, characterization and correlation with statistical process controlsThe LTC7804I is guaranteed over the –40°C to 125°C operating junction temperature range and the LTC7804H is guaranteed over the –40°C to 150°C operating junction temperature range and is tested at 150°CHigh junction temperatures degrade operating lifetimes; operating lifetime is derated for junction temperatures greater than 125°C Note that the maximum ambient temperature consistent with these specifications is determined by specific operating conditions in conjunction with board layout, the rated package thermal impedance and other environmental factorsThe junction temperature (T
J, in °C) is calculated from the ambient 
temperature (T A, in °C) and power dissipation (P D, in Watts) according 
to the formula: T J = TA + (P D  JA), where θ JA (in °C/W) is the package 
thermal impedance.Note 3: The LTC7804 is tested in a feedback loop that servos V ITH to a 
specified voltage and measures the resultant V FB
Note 4: Dynamic supply current is higher due to the gate charge being delivered at the switching frequencySee Applications informationNote 5: Rise and fall times are measured using 10% and 90% levelsDelay 
times are measured using 50% levelsNote 6 :
 The minimum on-time condition is specified for an inductor 
peak-to-peak ripple current >40% of I L(MAX)  (See Minimum On-Time 
Considerations in the Applications Information section).Note 7: This IC includes overtemperature protection that is intended to 
protect the device during momentary overload conditionsThe maximum rated junction temperature will be exceeded when this protection is activeContinuous operation above the specified absolute maximum operating junction temperature may impair device reliability or permanently damage the deviceNote 8: Do not apply a voltage or current source to these pinsThey must 
be connected to capacitive loads only, otherwise permanent damage may occur .

Main Control Loop
The LTC7804 uses a constant frequency, peak current 
mode step-up architectureDuring normal operation, the 
external bottom MOSFET is turned on when the clock 
sets the RS latch, and is turned off when the main current 
comparator , ICMP , resets the RS latchThe peak induc -
tor current at which ICMP trips and resets the latch is 
controlled by the voltage on the ITH pin, which is the 
output of the error amplifier , EAThe error amplifier com -
pares the output voltage feedback signal at the V FB pin 
(which is generated with an external resistor divider con -
nected across the output voltage, V OUT, to ground) to the 
internal 1.200V reference voltageWhen the load current 
increases, it causes a slight decrease in V FB relative to 
the reference, which causes the EA to increase the ITH 
voltage until the average inductor current matches the 
new load currentAfter the bottom MOSFET is turned off each cycle, the 
top MOSFET is turned on until either the inductor current 
starts to reverse, as indicated by the current comparator IR, or the beginning of the next clock cycleINTV
CC/EXTV CC Power
Power for the top and bottom MOSFET drivers and most 
other internal circuitry is derived from the INTV CC pin
When the EXTV CC pin is tied to a voltage less than 4.7V, 
the V BIAS LDO (low dropout linear regulator) supplies 
5.15V from V BIAS to INTV CCIf EXTV CC is taken above 
4.7V, the V BIAS LDO is turned off and an EXTV CC LDO is 
turned onOnce enabled, the EXTV CC LDO supplies 5.15V  
from EXTV CC to INTV CCUsing the EXTV CC pin allows the 
INTV CC power to be derived from a high efficiency external 
source such as a downstream switching regulator outputShutdown and Start-Up (RUN, SS Pins) 
The LTC7804 can be shut down using the RUN pinPulling 
this pin below 1.1V shuts down the main control loop
Pulling the RUN pin below 0.7V disables the controller and 
most internal circuits, including the INTV CC LDOsIn this 
state, the LTC7804 draws only 1.2μA of quiescent current.NOTE:  Do not apply a heavy load for an extended time 
while the chip is in shutdownThe top MOSFETs are 
turned off during shutdown and the output load may 
cause excessive dissipation in the body diodes 
The RUN pin needs to be externally pulled up or driven 
directly by logicIt can also be implemented as an under -
voltage lockout (UVLO) by connecting it to the output of an 
external resistor divider network off V IN (see Applications 
Information section)The start-up of the controller’ s output voltage V OUT is 
controlled by the voltage on the SS pinWhen the voltage on the SS pin is less than the 1.2V internal reference, the LTC7804 regulates the V
FB voltage to the SS pin voltage 
instead of the 1.2V referenceThis allows the SS pin to 
be used to program a soft-start by connecting an external 
capacitor from the SS pin to GNDAn internal 12.5μA  
pull-up current charges this capacitor creating a voltage ramp on the SS pinAs the SS voltage rises linearly from 0V to 1.2V (and beyond), the output voltage V
OUT rises 
smoothly to its final value
Light Load Current Operation:  Burst Mode Operation, 
Pulse-Skipping or Forced Continuous Mode (MODE Pin)
The LTC7804 can be enabled to enter high efficiency 
Burst Mode operation, constant frequency pulse-skipping 
mode, or forced continuous conduction mode at low load 
currents
To select Burst Mode operation, tie the MODE pin to 
GNDTo select forced continuous operation, tie the 
MODE pin to INTV CCTo select pulse-skipping mode, 
tie the MODE pin to a DC voltage greater than 1.2V and 
less than INTV CC – 1.3VAn internal 100k resistor to 
GND invokes Burst Mode operation when the MODE pin 
is floating and pulse-skipping mode when the MODE pin 
is tied to INTV CC through an external 100k resistor When the controller is enabled for Burst Mode operation, 
the minimum peak current in the inductor is set to approx -
imately 25% of the maximum sense voltage even though 
the voltage on the ITH pin indicates a lower valueIf the average inductor current is higher than the load current, or if V
IN > V OUT, the error amplifier , EA, will decrease the 
voltage on the ITH pinWhen the ITH voltage drops below 
LTC7804

RevB For more information www.analog.com0.425V , the internal sleep signal goes high (enabling 
sleep mode) and both external MOSFETs are turned off
The ITH pin is then disconnected from the output of the EA and parked at 0.45VIn the case of V
IN > V OUT, the 
LTC7804 will remain in sleep mode regardless of the load 
current through the body diode of the top MOSFET , which 
could then overheat, as discussed in the Operation When V
IN > V OUT sectionIn sleep mode, much of the internal circuitry is turned off, 
reducing the quiescent current that the LTC7804 draws 
to only 14μA
In sleep mode, the load current is supplied by the output 
capacitor As the output voltage decreases, the EA’s out -
put begins to riseWhen the output voltage drops enough, 
the ITH pin is reconnected to the output of the EA, the 
sleep signal goes low, and the controller resumes normal operation by turning on the bottom external MOSFET on the next cycle of the internal oscillator 
When the controller is enabled for Burst Mode operation, 
the inductor current is not allowed to reverseThe reverse 
current comparator , IR, turns off the top external MOSFET 
just before the inductor current reaches zero, preventing 
it from reversing and going negativeThus, the controller operates in discontinuous operationIn forced continuous operation or clocked by an external 
clock source to use the phase-locked loop, the inductor current is allowed to reverse at light loads or under large transient conditionsThe peak inductor current is deter -
mined by the voltage on the ITH pin, just as in normal 
operationIn this mode, the efficiency at light loads is 
lower than in Burst Mode operationHowever , continuous 
operation has the advantage of lower output voltage ripple 
and less interference to audio circuitryIn forced continu -
ous mode, the inductor current ripple is independent of load currentWhen the MODE pin is connected for pulse-skipping mode, the LTC7804 operates in PWM pulse-skipping 
mode at light loadsIn this mode, constant frequency 
operation is maintained down to approximately 1% of 
designed maximum output currentAt very light loads, the 
current comparator , ICMP , may remain tripped for several cycles and force the external bottom MOSFET to stay off for the same number of cycles (i.e., skipping pulses)The 
inductor current is not allowed to reverse (discontinuous operation)This mode, like forced continuous operation, exhibits low output ripple as well as low audio noise and 
reduced RF interference as compared to Burst Mode 
operationIt provides higher low current efficiency than forced continuous mode, but not nearly as high as Burst Mode operationUnlike forced continuous mode and pulse-skipping mode, 
Burst Mode cannot be synchronized to an external clockTherefore, if Burst Mode is selected and PLLIN/SPREAD pin is clocked to use the phase-locked loop, the LTC7804 switches from Burst Mode to forced continuous modeFrequency Selection, Spread Spectrum and Phase-
Locked-Loop (FREQ and PLLIN/SPREAD Pins)
The selection of switching frequency is a trade-off between 
efficiency and component sizeLow frequency opera -
tion increases efficiency by reducing MOSFET switching 
losses, but requires larger inductance and/or capacitance 
to maintain low output ripple voltageThe free running switching frequency of the LTC7804 is 
selected using the FREQ pinIf the PLLIN/SPREAD pin is not being driven by an external clock source, the FREQ pin can be tied to GND, tied to INTV
CC or programmed 
through an external resistor Tying FREQ to GND selects 
375kHz while tying FREQ to INTV CC selects 2.25MHz
Placing a resistor between FREQ and GND allows the fre -
quency to be programmed between 100kHz and 3MHz, as shown in Figure 6Switching regulators can be particularly troublesome for applications where electromagnetic interference 
(EMI) is a concernTo improve EMI, the LTC7804 can 
operate in spread spectrum mode, which is enabled by tying the PLLIN/SPREAD pin to INTV

of 1.6V (rising) and 1.1V (falling) and is guaranteed to 
operate with a clock signal swing of 0.5V to 2.5VOperation When V IN > V OUT
When the input voltage V IN rises above the regulated V OUT 
voltage, the boost controller behaves differently depend -

VIN exceeds the regulated V OUT in forced continuous

tinuouslyAn internal charge pump delivers current to 
the boost capacitor from the BOOST pin to maintain a 
sufficiently high TG voltage
If VIN is between 100% and 110% of the regulated V OUT 
voltage and pulse-skipping mode is selected, TG turns 
on if the inductor current rises above approximately 3% 
of the programmed current limitIf Burst Mode opera -
tion is selected, TG remains off regardless of the inductor 
currentIf VOUT is above 110% of the regulated V OUT voltage 
setpoint in forced continuous or pulse-skipping mode, 
the controller turns on TG continuously regardless of the 
inductor currentNote that a rising V IN must exceed the 
110% threshold by an offset voltage equal to the body 
diode of the high-side MOSFET In Burst Mode, the con -
troller also attempts to turn on TG when V OUT exceeds 
the 110% thresholdHowever , the internal charge pump is disabled if the chip is asleep due to burst mode opera -
tionWith the charge pump off, the boost capacitor may discharge, resulting in the TG voltage being insufficient 
to keep the top MOSFET completely onTo prevent exces -
sive power dissipation across the body diode of the top MOSFET in this situation, the chip can be switched over to forced continuous or pulse-skipping mode to enable the charge pump, or a Schottky diode can also be placed in parallel to the top MOSFET Operation at Low Input Voltage
The LTC7804 features a rail-to-rail current comparator 
which functions down to zero voltsThe minimum boost 
converter input voltage is therefore determined by the 
practical limitations of the boost converter architecture 
Since the input voltage could be lower than the 4.5V  VBIAS 
limit, V BIAS can be connected to the output of the boost 
controller , as illustrated in the typical application circuit 
in Figure 11This allows the boost controller to handle 
very low input voltage transients while maintaining output 
voltage regulation
BOOST Supply Refresh and Internal Charge Pump
The top MOSFET driver is biased from the floating boot -
strap capacitor , C B, which normally recharges during each 
cycle through an external low-leakage Schottky or PN 
Junction diode, D B, when the bottom MOSFET turns on
There are two considerations to keep the BOOST supply 
at the required bias levelDuring start-up, if the bottom MOSFET is not turned on within 100µs after UVLO goes low, the bottom MOSFET will be forced to turn on for a cumulative on-time of ~400nsThis forced refresh gener -
ates enough BOOST-SW voltage to allow the top MOSFET 
to be fully enhanced instead of waiting for the initial few 
cycles to charge the bootstrap capacitor , C BThere is also 
an internal charge pump that keeps the required bias on BOOST The charge pump always operates in both forced 
continuous mode and pulse-skipping modeIn Burst 
Mode operation, the charge pump is turned off during 
sleep and enabled when the chip wakes upThe internal charge pump can normally supply a charging current of 65µA.OPERATION

The Typical Application on the first page is a basic 
LTC7804 application circuitLTC7804 can be config -
ured to use either DCR (inductor resistance) sensing or 
low value resistor sensingThe choice between the two 
current sensing schemes is largely a design trade-off 
between cost, power consumption and accuracyDCR 
sensing is becoming popular because it saves expensive 
current sensing resistors and is more power efficient, 
especially in high current and lower frequency applica -
tionsHowever , current sensing resistors provide the 
most accurate current limits for the controller Other exter -
nal component selection is driven by the load require-
ment, and begins with the selection of R SENSE  (if R SENSE  
is used) and inductor valueNext, the power MOSFETs 
and Schottky diodes are selectedFinally, input and output 
capacitors are selectedSENSE+ and SENSE– Pins
The SENSE+ and SENSE– pins are the inputs to the cur -
rent comparatorsThe common mode voltage range on 
these pins is 0V
 to 40V (abs max), enabling the LTC7804 
to operate from input voltages up to a maximum of 40VThe SENSE– pin is high impedance drawing less 
than ≈±1μAThis high impedance allows the current com -
parators to be used in inductor DCR sensingThe impedance of the SENSE+ pin changes depending on 
the common mode voltageWhen SENSE+ is less than 
2.9V, it is relatively high impedance, drawing about 2μA
When SENSE+ is greater than 3.2V but is less than INTV CC 
– 0.5V, the pin draws about 30μA to bias internal circuitry
When SENSE+ is above INTV CC + 0.5V, a higher current 
(~650μA) flows into the pinBetween INTV CC – 0.5V and 
INTV CC + 0.5V, the current transitions from the smaller 
current to the higher currentFilter components mutual to the sense lines should be 
placed close to the LTC7804, and the sense lines should 
run close together to a Kelvin connection underneath the current sense element (shown in Figure 1)Sensing cur -
rent elsewhere can effectively add parasitic inductance 
and capacitance to the current sense element, degrading 
the information at the sense terminals and making the 
programmed current limit unpredictableIf inductor DCR sensing is used (Figure 2b), sense resistor R1 should be placed close to the switching node, to prevent noise from coupling into sensitive small-signal nodesThe maximum current limit threshold voltage of the cur -
rent comparator is programmed to be 50mV

Low Value Resistor Current Sensing
A typical sensing circuit using a discrete resistor is shown 
in Figure 2aR SENSE  is chosen based on the required out -
put currentThe current comparator has a maximum threshold 
VSENSE(MAX)  of 50mVThe current comparator threshold 
voltage sets the peak of the inductor current, yielding a 
maximum average inductor current, I L(MAX) , equal to the 
peak value less half the peak-to-peak ripple current, ∆I L
To calculate the sense resistor value, use the equation:
 RSENSE =VSENSE(MAX)
IL(MAX) +ΔIL
2
The actual value of I L(MAX)  depends on the required output 
current I OUT(MAX)  and can be calculated using:
 IL(MAX) =IOUT(MAX) VOUT
VIN⎛
⎝⎜⎞
⎠⎟
To ensure that the application will deliver full load cur -
rent over the full operating temperature range, choose 
the minimum value for V SENSE(MAX)  in the Electrical 
Characteristics table and account for tolerances in switch -
ing frequency, inductance, and R SENSE  resistance, as well 
as applicable voltage rangesTo avoid potential jitter or instability due to PCB noise cou-
pling into the current sense signal, the AC current sensing 
ripple of ∆VSENSE  = ∆IL  RSENSE  should also be checked to 
ensure a good signal-to-noise ratioIn general, for a rea -
sonably good PCB layout, a target V SENSE  AC ripple range 
of 10mV to 20mV at 50% duty cycle is recommended for 
both R SENSE  and DCR sensing applicationsThe parasitic inductance (ESL) of the sense resistor intro -
duces significant error in the current sense signal, par -
ticularly for lower inductor value (< 3µH ) or higher current 
(> 5A) applicationsThis error may be compensated for 
with an RC filter into the sense pins as shown in Figure  2a 
Set the RC filter time constant R F  CF = ESL/R SENSE  for 
optimal cancellation of the ESLSurface mount sense 
resistors in low ESL wide footprint geometries are rec -
ommended to minimize this error If not specified on the manufacturer ’ 
s data sheet, the ESL can be approximated as 0.4nH for a resistor with a 1206 footprint and 0.2nH for a 1225 footprintInductor DCR Sensing
For applications requiring the highest possible efficiency 
at high load currents, the LTC7804 is capable of sensing the voltage drop across the inductor DCR, as shown in Figure 2bThe DCR of the inductor represents the small amount of DC resistance of the copper wire, which can 
be less than 1mΩ for today’ s low value, high current 
inductorsIn a high current application requiring such 
an inductor , power loss through a sense resistor would 
cost several points of efficiency compared to inductor 
DCR sensingIf the external (R1||R2)  C1 time constant is chosen to 
be exactly equal to the L/DCR time constant, the voltage 
drop across the external capacitor is equal to the drop 
across the inductor DCR multiplied by R2/(R1 + R2)R2 scales the voltage across the sense terminals for appli -
cations where the DCR is greater than the target sense 
resistor valueTo properly dimension the external filter 
components, the DCR of the inductor must be knownIt can be measured using a good RLC meter , but the DCR 
tolerance is not always the same and varies with tempera -
ture; consult the manufacturers’ data sheets for detailed informationUsing the inductor ripple current value from the Inductor

 RSENSE ≤VSENSE(MAX)

To ensure that the application will deliver full load cur -
rent over the full operating temperature range, choose the 
minimum value for the maximum current sense threshold 
VSENSE(MAX)  in the Electrical Characteristics tableNext, determine the DCR of the inductor When provided, 
use the manufacturer’s maximum value, usually given at 20°CIncrease this value to account for the temperature coefficient of copper resistance, which is approximately 0.4%/°CA conservative value for T
L(MAX)  is 100°C.

Ensure that R1 has a power rating higher than this valueIf high efficiency is necessary at light loads, consider this power loss when deciding whether to use DCR sensing 
or sense resistorsLight load power loss can be mod -
estly higher with a DCR network than with a sense resis-
tor , due to the extra switching losses incurred through 
R1However , DCR sensing eliminates a sense resistor , 
reduces conduction losses and provides higher efficiency 
at heavy loadsPeak efficiency is about the same with 
either methodInductor Value Calculation
The operating frequency and inductor selection are inter -
related in that higher operating frequencies allow the use 
of smaller inductor and capacitor valuesSo why would anyone ever 
choose to operate at lower frequencies with 
larger components?  The answer is efficiencyA higher 
frequency generally results in lower efficiency because of MOSFET switching and gate charge lossesIn addi -
tion to this basic trade-off, the effect of inductor value 
on ripple current and low current operation must also be consideredThe maximum average inductor current in continuous 
conduction mode is equal to the maximum average out -
put current multiplied by a factor of V OUT/VIN, or I L(MAX)  
= IOUT(MAX) VOUT/VINBe aware that the maximum out -
put current decreases with decreasing V INThe choice of 
IL(MAX)  therefore depends on the maximum load current 
for a regulated V OUT at the minimum normal operating 
VINIf the load current limit for a given V IN is exceeded, 
VOUT will decrease until the I L(MAX)  = IOUT(MAX) VOUT/VIN 
equation is satisfied Additionally, when the output is in 
overvoltage (V IN >VOUT), the top switch is on continuously 
and the maximum load current is equal to I L(MAX) The 
inductor ripple current ∆IL for a boost regulator is:
 ΔIL=1
f LVIN1–VIN
VOUT⎛
⎝⎜⎞
⎠⎟
Accepting larger values of ∆I L allows the use of low induc -
tances, but results in higher output voltage ripple and 
greater core lossesA reasonable starting point for set -
ting ripple current is ∆I L = 0.3 I L(MAX) The maximum ∆I L 
occurs at V IN = 1/2V OUTThe inductor value also has secondary effectsThe tran -
sition to Burst Mode operation begins when the average 
inductor current required results in a 
peak current below 
25% of the current limit determined by R SENSE Lower 
inductor values (higher ∆I L) will cause this to occur at 
lower load currents, which can cause a dip in efficiency in 
the upper range of low current operationIn Burst Mode operation, lower inductance values will cause the burst frequency to decrease
Inductor Core Selection
Once the value for L is known, the type of inductor must 
be selectedHigh efficiency converters generally cannot 
afford the core loss found in low cost powdered iron cores, 
forcing the use of more expensive ferrite or molypermal-
loy coresActual core loss is independent of core size for a 
fixed inductor value, but it is very dependent on inductance APPLICATIONS INFORMATION

RevB For more information www.analog.comvalue selectedAs inductance increases, core losses go 
downUnfortunately, increased inductance requires more 
turns of wire and therefore copper losses will increaseFerrite designs have very low core loss and are preferred 
for high switching frequencies, so design goals can con -
centrate on copper loss and preventing saturationFerrite 
core material saturates hard, which means that induc -
tance collapses abruptly when the peak design current is exceededThis results in an abrupt increase in inductor ripple current and consequent output voltage rippleDo 
not allow the core to saturate! The inductor saturation 
design margin should account for the tolerance and tem-perature effects on the saturation currentPower MOSFET Selection
T wo external power MOSFETs must be selected for the 
LTC7804 controller: one N-channel MOSFET for the bot-
tom (main) switch, and one N-channel MOSFET for the top (synchronous) switchThe peak-to-peak drive levels are set by the INTV CC 
voltageThis voltage is typically 5.15V  during start-up 
(see EXTV CC Pin Connection)Consequently, logic-level 
threshold MOSFETs must be used in most applications
Pay close attention to the BV DSS specification for the 
MOSFETs as wellSelection criteria for the power MOSFETs include the 
onresistance, R DS(ON) , Miller capacitance, C MILLER , input 
voltage and maximum output currentMiller capacitance, 
CMILLER , can be approximated from the gate charge curve 
usually provided on the MOSFET manufacturers’  data 
sheetC MILLER  is equal to the increase in gate charge 
along the horizontal axis while the curve is approximately 
flat divided by the specified change in V DSThis result is 
then multiplied by the ratio of the application applied V DS 
to the gate charge curve specified V DSWhen the IC is 
operating in continuous mode the duty cycles for the top and bottom MOSFETs are given by:

equation includes an additional term for transition losses, 
which are highest at high output voltagesFor V OUT < 
20V and moderate switching frequencies, the high current 
efficiency generally improves with larger MOSFETs, while 
for V OUT > 20V the transition losses rapidly increase to the 
point that the use of a higher R DS(ON)  device with lower 
CMILLER  actually provides higher efficiencyThe synchro -

in general, the higher the source impedance, the higher 
the required input capacitanceThe required amount of 
input capacitance is also greatly affected by the duty cycle
High output current applications that also experience high 
duty cycles can place great demands on the input supply, both in terms of DC current and ripple current
The output current in a boost converter is discontinu -

the QFN package from a 40V supply when not using the EXTV

 TJ = 70°C + (20mA)(40V)(68°C/W for QFN) = 125°C 
In the MSOP package, the INTV CC current is limited to less 
than 34mA from a 40V supply:
 TJ = 70°C + (34mA)(40V)(40°C/W for MSOP) = 125°C 
To prevent the maximum junction temperature from being

VBIAS LDO is turned off and the EXTV CC LDO is enabled
The EXTV CC LDO remains on as long as the voltage applied

is less than 5.15V, the LDO is in dropout and the INTV CC 
voltage is approximately equal to EXTV CCWhen EXTV CC

An external bootstrap capacitor C B connected to the 
BOOST pin supplies the gate drive voltage for the topside MOSFET Capacitor C
B in the Block Diagram is charged 
though external diode D B from INTV CC when the SW pin 
is lowWhen the topside MOSFET is to be turned on, the driver places the C
B voltage across the gate and source 
of the desired MOSFET This enhances the MOSFET and 
turns on the topside switchFor typical applications, a 
suitable value of C B is in the 0.1µF to 0.47µF rangeThe 
switch node voltage, SW , rises to V OUT and the BOOST pin followsWith the topside MOSFET on, the boost voltage 
is above the output voltage:  VBOOST = VOUT + VINTVCC The 
value of the boost capacitor C B needs to be 100 times that 
of the total input capacitance of the topside MOSFET(s)
For typical applications, a suitable value of C B is in the 
0.1µF to 0.47µF rangeThe reverse breakdown of the 
external diode D B must be greater than V OUT(MAX) The external diode D B can be a Schottky diode or silicon 
diode, but in either case it should have low leakage and fast recoveryPay close attention to the reverse leakage at high temperatures, where it generally increases sub -
stantiallyA leaky diode not only increases the quiescent 
current of the boost converter , but it can create a cur -
rent path from the BOOST pin to INTV CCThis will cause 
INTV CC to rise if the diode leakage exceeds the current 
consumption on INTV CC, which is primarily a concern in 
Burst Mode operation where the load on INTV CC can be 
very smallThere is an internal voltage clamp on INTV CC 
that prevents the INTV CC voltage from running away, but 
this clamp should be regarded as a failsafe only

pump that delivers current to the bootstrap capacitor from 
the BOOST pinThis charge current maintains the bias 
voltage required to keep the top MOSFET on continuously 
during pass-through/overvoltage conditionsIn applica-
tions supporting pass-through or overvoltage conditions,

The LTC7804 has an internal phase-locked loop (PLL) com -
prised of a phase frequency detector , a lowpass filter , and a 
voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)This allows the turn-on 
of the bottom MOSFET to be locked to the rising edge of 
an external clock signal applied to the PLLIN/SPREAD pin
The phase detector is an edge sensitive digital type that 
provides zero degrees phase shift between the external and 
internal oscillatorsThis type of phase detector does not exhibit false lock to harmonics of the external clock.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION

In general, the requirements of each application will dictate 
the appropriate choice for light-load operating modeIn 
Burst Mode operation, the inductor current is not allowed to reverseThe reverse current comparator turns off the 
top MOSFET just before the inductor current reaches zero, 
preventing it from reversing and going negativeThus, 
the regulator operates in discontinuous conductionIn 
addition, when the load current is very light, the inductor 
current will begin bursting at frequencies lower than the switching frequency, and enter a low current sleep mode 
when not switchingAs a result, Burst Mode operation 
has the highest possible efficiency at light loadIn forced continuous mode, the inductor current is 
allowed to reverse at light loads and switches at the same 
frequency regardless of loadIn this mode, the efficiency at light loads is considerably lower than in Burst Mode operationHowever , continuous operation has the advan -
tage of lower output voltage ripple and less interference to 
audio circuitryIn forced continuous mode, the inductor current ripple is independent of load currentIn pulse-skipping mode, constant frequency operation is 
maintained down to approximately 1% of designed maxi -
mum output currentAt very light loads, the PWM com -
parator may remain tripped for several cycles and force the bottom MOSFET to stay off for the same number of cycles 
(i.e., skipping pulses)The inductor current is not allowed 
to reverse (discontinuous operation)This mode, like forced continuous operation, exhibits low output ripple as well as low audio noise and reduced RF interference as compared 
to Burst Mode operationIt provides higher light load effi -
ciency than forced continuous mode, but not nearly as high 
as Burst Mode operationConsequently, pulse-skipping mode 
represents a compromise between light load efficiency, out-put ripple and EMI
In some applications, it may be desirable to change light 
load operating mode based on the conditions present in 
the systemFor example, if a system is inactive, one might 
select high efficiency Burst Mode operation by keeping 
the MODE pin set to 0VWhen the system wakes, one 
might send an external clock to PLLIN/SPREAD, or tie 
MODE to INTV CC to switch to low noise forced continu-
ous modeSuch on-the-fly mode changes can allow an individual application 
to benefit from the advantages of 
each light -load operating mode.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION

ables the INTV CC LDO, causing the INTV CC supply to col -
lapse and effectively shut down the entire LTC7804 chip
When the junction temperature drops back to approxi -
mately 160˚C, the INTV CC LDO turns back onLong-term 
overstress (T J > 125˚ C) should be avoided as it can 
degrade the performance or shorten the life of the partEfficiency Considerations
The percent efficiency of a switching regulator is equal to 
the output power divided by the input power times 100%
It is often useful to analyze individual losses to determine 
what is limiting the efficiency and which change would 
produce the most improvementPercent efficiency can 
be expressed as:
 %Efficiency = 100% – (L1 + L2 + L3 + .) 
where L1, L2, etcare the individual losses as a per
cent-
age of input power .Although all dissipative elements in the circuit produce 
losses, four main sources usually account for most of the 
losses in LTC7804 circuits:  1) IC V BIAS current, 2) INTV CC 
regulator current, 3) I2R losses, 4) bottom side MOSFET 
transition losses.1 The V BIAS current is the DC supply current given in 
the Electrical Characteristics table, which excludes 
MOSFET driver and control currentsV BIAS current 
typically results in a small (<0.1%) loss2INT
VCC current is the sum of the MOSFET driver and 
control currentsThe MOSFET driver current results 
from switching the gate capacitance of the power 
MOSFETsEach time a MOSFET gate is switched 
from low to high to low again, a packet of charge, d q, 
moves from INTV CC to groundThe resulting d q/dt is 
a current out of INTV CC that is typically much larger 
than the control circuit currentIn continuous mode, I
GATECHG  = f(QT + QB) , where QT and QB are the gate 
charges of the topside and bottom side MOSFETs3I2R losses are predicted from the DC resistances of 
the fuse (if used), MOSFET , inductor , current sense 
resistor and input and input capacitor ESRIn con -
tinuous mode the average input current flows through 
L and R SENSE , but is chopped between the topside 
MOSFET and the synchronous MOSFET If the two 
MOSFETs have approximately the same R DS(ON) , then 
the resistance of one MOSFET can simply be summed 
with the resistances of L, R SENSE  and ESR to obtain 
I2R losses4T ransition losses apply only to the bottom MOSFET 
and become significant only when operating at higher 
output voltages (typically 15V or greater) or at high 
frequency (MHz range)T ransition losses can be esti -
mated from the equation for the main switch power dissipation in the Power MOSFET Selection section
Other hidden losses such as copper trace and internal battery resistances can account for an additional 5% to 10% efficiency degradation in portable systemsIt is very important to include these system level losses during the design phaseThe internal battery and fuse resistance losses can be minimized by making sure that C
IN has adequate charge storage and very low ESR at the APPLICATIONS INFORMATION

a minimum of 20μF to 40μF of capacitance having a maximum of 20mΩ to 50mΩ of ESROther losses includ -
ing body diode conduction losses during dead-time and in
ductor core losses generally account for less than 2% 
total additional loss but can be significant when operating at high switching frequenciesChecking T ransient Response
The regulator loop response can be checked by looking at 
the load current transient responseSwitching regulators 
take several cycles to respond to a step in DC (resistive) 
load currentWhen a load step occurs, V OUT shifts by an 
amount equal to ∆I LOAD (ESR), where ESR is the effective 
series resistance of C OUT∆ILOAD also begins to charge or 
discharge C OUT generating the feedback error signal that 
forces the regulator to adapt to the current change and 
return V OUT to its steady-state valueDuring this recovery 
time V OUT can be monitored for excessive overshoot or 
ringing, which would indicate a stability problemOPTI-LOOP compensation allows the transient response to be 
optimized over a wide range of output capacitance and 
ESR valuesThe availability of the ITH pin not only allows optimization of control loop behavior , but it also provides a DC coupled and AC filtered closed-loop response test pointThe DC step, rise time and settling at this test point truly reflects the closed-loop responseAssuming a pre -
dominantly second order system, phase margin and/or 
damping factor can be estimated using the percentage 
of overshoot seen at this pinThe bandwidth can also be estimated by examining the rise time at the pinThe ITH external components shown in the first page circuit will provide an adequate starting point for most applicationsThe ITH series R
C−CC filter sets the dominant pole-zero 
loop compensationThe values can be modified slightly 
to optimize transient response once the final PC layout is done and the particular output capacitor type and value have been determinedThe output capacitors need to be selected because the various types and values determine the loop gain and phaseAn output current pulse of 20% to 80% of full-load current having a rise time of 1μs to 10μs will produce output voltage and ITH pin waveforms that will give a sense of the overall loop stability without breaking the feedback loop.Placing a power MOSFET directly across the output 
capacitor and driving the gate with an appropriate signal 
generator is a practical way to produce a realistic load step 
conditionThe initial output voltage step resulting from the step change in output current may not be within the bandwidth of the feedback loop, so this signal cannot be 
used to determine phase marginThis is why it is better to 
look at the ITH pin signal which is in the feedback loop and 
is the filtered and compensated control loop responseThe gain of the loop will be increased by increasing 
RC and the bandwidth of the loop will be increased by 
decreasing C CIf R C is increased by the same factor that 
CC is decreased, the zero frequency will be kept the same, 
thereby keeping the phase shift the same in the most 
critical frequency range of the feedback loopThe output voltage settling behavior is related to the stability of the closed-loop system and will demonstrate the actual over -
all supply performanceA second, more severe transient is caused by switching 
in loads with large (>1μF
) supply bypass capacitorsThe 
discharged bypass capacitors are effectively put in parallel 
with C OUT, causing a rapid drop in V OUTNo regulator can 
alter its delivery of current quickly enough to prevent this sudden step change in output voltage if the load switch 
resistance is low and it is driven quicklyIf the ratio of 
CLOAD to C OUT is greater than 1:50, the switch rise time 
should be controlled so that the load rise time is limited 
to approximately 25   CLOADThus a 10μF capacitor would 
require a 250μs rise time, limiting the charging current to about 200mA
Design Example
As a design example, assume V
IN = 12V (nominal), V IN 
= 22V (max), V OUT = 24V, I OUT(MAX)  = 4A and f = 1MHz
The frequency is not one of the internal preset values, so 
a resistor from the FREQ pin to GND is required, with a value of:
 RFREQ(in  kΩ)≤37MHz
1 MHz= 37kΩAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION

current assumptionThe minimum inductance for 30% 
ripple current is:

⎠⎟
The largest ripple happens when V IN = 1/2V OUT = 12V, 
where the average maximum inductor current is I L(MAX)

duce 31% ripple currentThe peak inductor current will 
be the maximum DC value plus one half the ripple current, 
or 9.25A
The minimum on-time occurs at maximum V IN:
 tON(MIN) <VOUT−VIN(MAX)  
VOUT f=2V
24V  1 MHz=83ns
If the minimum on time of 80ns is violated, the LTC7804 
skips pulses at high input voltage, resulting in lower fre-quency operation and higher inductor current ripple than desiredIf undesirable, this behavior can be avoided by 
decreasing the frequency (with the inductor value accord -
ingly adjusted) to avoid operation near the minimum 
on-timeThe equivalent R SENSE  resistor value can be calculated by 
using the minimum value for the maximum current sense 
threshold (50mV):
 RSENSE≤45mV
9.25A≈0.004Ω
To allow for additional margin, a lower value R SENSE  
may be used;  however , be sure that the inductor satu -
ration current has sufficient margin above V SENSE(MAX) /
RSENSE , where the maximum value of 55mV is used for 
VSENSE(MAX) Choosing 1% resistors: R A = 11.3k and R B = 215k yields 
an output voltage of 24.032V.The best way to evaluate MOSFET performance in a par -
ticular application is to build and test the circuit on the 
bench, facilitated by an LTC7804 demo boardHowever , an 
educated guess about the application is helpful to initially 
select MOSFETsT ransition losses will likely dominate over I2R losses for the bottom MOSFET Therefore, choose 
a MOSFET with higher R DS(ON)  as opposed to lower gate 
charge to minimize the combined loss termsThe top 
MOSFET does not experience transition losses, and its 
power loss is generally dominated by I2R lossesFor 
this reason, the top MOSFET is typically chosen to be of 
lower R DS(ON)  and subsequently higher gate charge than 
the bottom MOSFET Be sure to select logic-level thresh -
old MOSFETs, since the gate drive voltage is limited to
