    "155": "Circuit Operation\nThe L TC6416 is a low noise and low distortion fully dif-\nferential unity-gain ADC driver with operation from DC to 2GHz (–3dB bandwidth), a differential input impedance of 12kΩ, and a differential output impedance of 18ΩThe L TC6416 is composed of a fully differential buffer with output common mode voltage control circuitry and high speed voltage-limiting clamps at the outputSmall output resistors of 9Ω improve the circuit stability over various load conditionsThey also simplify possible external ﬁ  lter-\ning options, which are often desirable when the load is an ADCLowpass or bandpass ﬁ  lters are easily implemented \nwith just a few external componentsThe L TC6416 is very ﬂ  exible in terms of I/O couplingIt can be AC- or DC-coupled at the inputs, the outputs or bothWhen using the L TC6416 with DC-coupled inputs, best performance is obtained with an input common mode voltage between 1V and 1.5V For AC-coupled operation, the L TC6416 will take the voltage applied to the V\nCM pin and use it to bias the \ninputs so that the output common mode voltage equals V\nCM, thus no external circuitry is neededThe V CM pin \nhas been designed to directly interface with the V CM pin \nfound on Linear Technology’s 16-, 14- and 12-bit high speed ADC familiesInput Impedance and Matching\nThe L TC6416 has a high differential input impedance of \n12kΩThe differential inputs may need to be terminated to a lower value impedance, e.g50Ω, in order to provide an impedance match for the sourceFigure 1 shows input matching using a 1:1 balun, while Figure 2 shows match-\ning using a 1:4 balunThese circuits provide a wideband impedance matchThe balun and matching resistors must be placed close to the input pins in order to minimize the rejection due to input mismatchIn Figure 1, the capaci-tor center-tapping the two 24.9Ω resistors improves high frequency common mode rejectionAs an alternative to this wideband approach, a narrowband impedance match can be used at the inputs of the L TC6416 for frequency selection and/or noise reductionThe noise performance of the L TC6416 also depends upon \nthe source impedance and terminationFor example, the input 1:4 balun in Figure 2 improves SNR by adding 6dB of voltage gain at the inputsA trade-off between gain and noise is obvious when constant noise ﬁ  gure circle and constant gain circle are plotted within the same input Smith ChartThis technique can be used to determine the optimal source impedance for a given gain and noise requirementOutput Match and Filter\nThe L TC6416 provides a source resistance of 9Ω at each \noutputFor testing purposes, Figure 3 and Figure 4 show the L TC6416 driving a differential 400Ω load impedance using a 1:1 or 1:4 balun, respectivelyThe L TC6416 can drive an ADC directly without external \noutput impedance matching, but improved performance can usually be obtained with the addition of a few external componentsFigure 5 shows a typical topology used for driving the L TC2208 16-bit ADCFigure 1Input Termination for Differential 50Ω Input Impedance Using a 1:1 Balun\nVININ+\nIN–3\n424.9Ω 0.1μF\n50Ω\n24.9Ω\nOUT–\n6416 F01OUT+\n78\nL TC6416\n0.1μF0.1μF\n1:1\n+–\nLTC6416\n146416f\n165Ω0.1μF\n0.1μF 1:1\n0.1μFIN+\nIN–3\n4OUT–\n6416 F03OUT+\n78\nL TC641650Ω\n165Ω\nVININ+\nIN–3\n4100Ω\n100Ω50Ω\nOUT–\n6416 F02OUT+\n78\nL TC6416\n0.1μF0.1μF\n1:4\n+–0.1μF APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure 2Input Termination for Differential 50Ω Input Impedance Using a 1:4 Balun\nFigure 3Output Termination for Differential 400Ω Load Impedance Using a 1:1 Balun\nFigure 4Output Termination for Differential 400Ω Load Impedance Using a 4:1 Balun90.9Ω0.1μF\n0.1μF 4:1\n0.1μFIN+\nIN–3\n4OUT–\n6416 F04OUT+\n78\nL TC641650Ω\n90.9Ω\nFigure 5DC1257B Simpliﬁ  ed Schematic with Suggested Output Termination for Driving an L TC2208 16-Bit ADC at 140MHzV+\nVCM\nOUT–\n6416 F05OUT+3.6V\n2.2μF\nIN+CLHI\nCLLOIN–L TC6416 1pF\n1.5pF1.5pF3.3V\nCLOCK\n(130MHz)DATA16VCM\nL TC2208AIN+\nAIN–25Ω\n25ΩGNDGNDR36\n100Ω\nR15\n100Ω0.1μF\nC39\n0.01μF3\n2\n1 64\n50Ω680pF\nT1\nTCM4-19+\n+–\nLTC6416",
