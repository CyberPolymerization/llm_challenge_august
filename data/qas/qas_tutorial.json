    "question": "What is the purpose of the Conditional Search ROM command in the DS28E04-100 module?",
    "answer": "The purpose of the Conditional Search ROM command in the DS28E04-100 module is to allow the bus master to identify devices on a multidrop system that fulfill certain conditions (CSR = 1) and have to signal an important event. Only those devices that fulfill the conditions will participate in the search. After each pass of the conditional search that successfully determined the 64-bit ROM code for a specific device on the multidrop bus, that particular device can be individually accessed as if a Match ROM had been issued, since all other devices will have dropped out of the search process and will be waiting for a reset pulse.",

    "question": "What is the recommended range for the value of C1 in the LTC7804 module and why is it chosen in that range?",
    "answer": "The recommended range for the value of C1 in the LTC7804 module is 0.1μF to 0.47μF. It is chosen in that range to force R1 || R2 to around 2k, reducing error that might have been caused by the SENSE− pin’s ±1μA current.",
