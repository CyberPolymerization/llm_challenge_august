This reduces noise levels on the communication lines, and often only a split termination is required.\n\n2. Capacitive Isolation Coupling: In designs with low noise requirements, a simplified capacitor-isolated coupling can replace the transformer. This circuit uses two 10nF capacitors and a common mode choke (CMC) for noise rejection.\n\n3. Transformer Selection: When choosing a transformer, it is important to consider primary inductance, leakage inductance, pulse shape, and parallel winding capacitance. Transformers with primary inductances above 60μH and a 1:1 turns ratio are recommended. Transformers with less than 2.5μH of leakage inductance are also preferred. It is best to select a transformer with less parallel winding capacitance when possible.\n\n4. Common Mode Chokes: In most applications, a common mode choke (CMC) is necessary for noise rejection. The datasheet recommends using the TDK ACT45B-101-2P or the Murata DLW43SH101XK2 CMCs.\n\nOverall, following these layout guidelines will help maximize the noise immunity of the isoSPI signal lines when using the LTC6812-1 module.",
